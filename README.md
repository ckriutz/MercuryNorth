# MercuryNorth
A simple web project for demos and experiments done in both asp.net, and node.js so that they can be deployed in differnet situations and environments. There is not a lot of complexity in these sites so there is very little required to get them up and running.

Originally, the design for the site came from:
 Start Bootstrap - Landing Page (http://startbootstrap.com/)
 Copyright 2013-2016 Start Bootstrap
 Licensed under MIT (https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE)

...however many changes have been made to the application since then to reflect the nature of the site.
